NAME
    Term::ExtendedColor::Dzen - Color input and add dzen(2) compatible
    attributes

SYNOPSIS
        use Term::ExtendedColor::Dzen qw(fgd bgd);

        print fgd('#ff0000', 'this is red foreground');
        print bgd('#fff00',  'this is yellow background');

        print fgd('#000', bgd('#ffffff', 'this is black on white background'));

DESCRIPTION
    Term::ExtendedColor::Dzen provides functionality for coloring input data
    with dzen compatible attributes.

EXPORTS
    None by default.

FUNCTIONS
  fgd('#fff', $string)
    Sets foreground color. When called without arguments, returns the fg
    reset string.

        my $white_fg = fgd('#fff', 'white foreground');

  bgd('#000', $string)
    Sets background color. When called without arguments, returns the bg
    reset string.

        my $black_bg = bg('#000', 'black background');

    Like "fgd()", but sets background colors.

    These two can be combined:

        my $str = fgd('#000', bgd('#ffffff', 'this is black on white background'));

    which yields the combined string:

        ^fg(#000)^bg(#fff)this is black on white background^bg()^fg()
